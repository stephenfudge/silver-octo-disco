## Horiseon Social Solution Services - Challenge Assignment 1 HTML, Git, and CSS

- What was your motivation? To fix code that had some issues and to clean up the code to be cleaner to look at as well.
- Why did you build this project? To become better using HTML and CSS for webpages. 
- What problem does it solve?  It solves the problem of messy code and non functioning links. 
- What did I learn?  I learned what a Semantic HTML tag is and how to implement them. I learned how to consolidate and clean up code that has been pre-written by somebody else. 

Updated the title from "website" to "Horiseon Social Solution Services". Renamed all the div tags to the appropriate semantic HTML tags (header, nav, section, footer, etc.)
The CSS file had a lot of repeated information for different IDs, consolidated that into classes.
Added comments to both the HTML and CSS files so that it's easier to see what parts of the code are supposed to do what.

## Credits

I used w3schools.com to assist with the CSS for the links inside the header to put them in a line and also for how to apply padding on images.
